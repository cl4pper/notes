## Meetings:

### Comeback daily (15min):
Each team member pass through their weekend before presenting their plan for the working week.

### Daily (10min):
Review the sprint status based on the tasks (apply the ["Walk the Wall"](https://medium.com/serious-scrum/walking-the-board-on-daily-scrum-5b468c760329) approach).

### Tasks brooming (30min):
Where the new tasks, before the planning, are defined.
- squad members can raise tasks and work over their descriptions
- the squad should validate the tasks and see if makes any sense to add them into the planning

### Retro (15min):
Review what has been done during the sprint.
- move tasks yet to be completed away from the sprint
- if any suggestion is raised, add to the **sprint goals**

### Planning (30min):
Define the tasks and goals for the sprint.
- return unfinished tasks to the sprint board
- classify tasks from the *Ice box* by adding sprint points
- move tasks from the *Ice box* into the sprint board
